- The 1st assignment dealt with introducing the user to basic R commands.
- The 2nd assignment dealt with executing simple probability and statistical questions using R. 
- The 3rd asssignment was about summarizing data from the built in Crime dataset and simulating patterns using the *Monte Carlo Method*.
