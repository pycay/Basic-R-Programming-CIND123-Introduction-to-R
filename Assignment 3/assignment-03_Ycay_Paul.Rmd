This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. 
Edit the file `assignment-4.Rmd` and insert your R code where wherever you see the string "INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE"

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(2,4,6,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
seq(2,20,by = 2)
```

In this assignment, questions 1 - 4 make use of data that is provided by the
`mosaic` package.  (install mosaic package and load KidsFeet using data(KidsFeet) ). 
```{r}
install.packages('mosaic',repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(mosaic)
data(KidsFeet)
```


## Question 1 - 30%
This question makes use of package "plm", and load Crime dataset as following:
```{r load_packages}
install.packages("plm",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(plm) 
data(Crime)
```

a) Display the first 8 rows of crime and make note of all the variables and print all column (variable) names. Display summary of each variable.
```{r}
head(Crime,8)
summary(head(Crime,8))
```

b) Calculate the mean,variance and standard deviation of tax revenue per capita (taxpc) by omitting the missing values, if any.
```{r}
mean(Crime$taxpc,na.rm=TRUE)
var(Crime$taxpc,na.rm=TRUE)
sd(Crime$taxpc,na.rm=TRUE)

```

c) Use `density` and `smsa` variables build a multiple linear regression model to predict tax per capita (taxpc), display a summary of your model indicating Residuals, Coefficients..etc. What can you say about your model? 
```{r}
model<-lm(taxpc~density+smsa,data=Crime)
summary(model)
```

d)Based on the output of your model, write the equations based on the intercept and factors of `smsa` when `density` is set to 2.4. and compare the result with `predict()` function. Hint: Explore `predict()` function
```{r}
smsaYES<-29.5615-0.2345*2.4+11.280*1
smsaYES
smsaNO<-29.5615-0.2345*2.4
smsaNO
dfyes<-data.frame(density=c(2.4),smsa=c('yes'))
predict(model,dfyes)
dfno<-data.frame(density=c(2.4),smsa=c('no'))
predict(model,dfno)
#the results are very close to each other
```

e)Find Pearson correlation between density and tax per capita; between density and police per capita (polpc) Please comment on the result with a sentence.
```{r}
cor_density_tax<-cor(Crime$density,Crime$taxpc)
cor_density_tax
cor_density_police<-cor(Crime$density,Crime$polpc)
cor_density_police
#density vs. tax has a weak but positive correlation, dnsity vs police has a weak but negative correlation
```
f)Write the correlation matrix of the variables: avgsen, polpc, density, taxpc. Hint: Explore the variables by ?Crime. Comment on the result with a sentence.
```{r}
cor(Crime[,7:10])
```

## Question 2 -30%
 
a) First and second midterm grades of some students are given as c(55,76,48,58,80,75,32,22) and c(85,76,78,88,90,95,42,31). Set R variables `first` and `second` respectively.
```{r}
first <- c(85,76,78,88,90,95,42,31)
second <- c(55,76,48,58,80,75,32,22)
```
b) Apply the lm() function to observe the relationship between the first and the second midterm grades. Hint: Second midterm is the response variable.
```{r}
model2 <- lm(second~first)
summary(model2)
```

c) Find the second midterm grade of a student given that his/her first midterm grade is 72. Print the result by using print() function. 
```{r}
result <-  predict(model2,data.frame(first = 72))
print(result)
```

## Question 3 - 40%

$\pi$ appears in the formula for the standard normal distribution, the most important probability distribution in statistics. Why not give it a try to calculate $\pi$ using statistics! In fact, you'll use a simulation technique called the *Monte Carlo Method*.

Recall that the area of a circle of radius $r$ is $A = \pi r^2$. Therefore the area of a circle of radius 1, aka a *unit circle*, is $\pi$. You'll compute an approximation to the area of this circle using the Monte Carlo Method.

a) The Monte Carlo Method uses random numbers to simulate some process. Here the process is throwing darts at a square. Assume the darts are uniformly distributed over the square. Imagine a unit circle enclosed by a square whose sides are of length 2. Set an R variable `area.square` to be the area of a square whose sides are of length 2.

```{r}
area.square <- 2*2
area.square
```
b) The points of the square can be given x-y coordinates. Let both x and y range from -1 to +1 so that the square is centred on the origin of the coordinate system. Throw some darts at the square by generating random numeric vectors x and y, each of length `N = 10,000`. Set R variables `x` and `y` each to be uniformly distributed random numbers in the range -1 to +1.
(hint: runif() generates random number for the uniform distribution)
```{r}
N  <- 10000
x <- runif(N, min=-1, max=1)
y <- runif(N, min=-1, max=1)
```
c) Now count how many darts landed inside the unit circle. Recall that a point is inside the unit circle when $x^2 + y^2 < 1$. Save the result of successful hits in a variable named hit. 
(hint: a for loop over the length of x and y is one option to reach hit)
```{r}
hit <- 0
for (i in 1:N){
  if((x[i]^2+y[i]^2)<=1) 
    hit<-hit+1}
print (hit)
```
d) The probability that a dart hits inside the circle is proportional to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. Use this fact to calculate an approximation to $\pi$ and print the result
```{r}
pi <- (4*hit)/N
print(pi)
```
Wow you got the first estimate for `pi` $\pi$, congratulations you have completed the first run of the Monte Carlo simulation.
If there is further interest put all the above logic in a function, and call it 50 times store the results in a vector called pi then take the mean of pi vector.
